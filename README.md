# TeamBuilder

TeamBuilder is an easy tool to create pairs or smaller teams from a group 
of people. Just enter the names and select how many teams you want to create.

If you intend to create pairs (or teams with more members) who want to use 
the driver-navigator-principle, just flip the switch and let the tool create 
driver for you.
