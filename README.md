# TeamBuilder

TeamBuilder is a user-friendly tool designed to efficiently organize groups into 
pairs or smaller teams. Simply input the names and specify the desired number of 
teams to be generated.

For those utilizing the driver-navigator principle, the tool offers a convenient 
toggle feature to assign drivers automatically. Just enable this option, and 
TeamBuilder will handle the rest.
